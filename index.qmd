Species distribution models (SDM), also known as niche models, combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes [@elith2009]. They have become an important tool in the toolbox of ecologists and professionals involved in e.g., nature conservation, biodiversity monitoring and environmental impact assessment.

This tutorial introduces the Maxent tool set in GRASS, and illustrates how to use it with other modules to create an effective and flexible analytical workflow.

Maxent [@phillipsMaximumEntropyModeling2006a,@phillipsOpeningBlackBox2017a] is one of the more popular algorithms for species distribution modeling. Unlike many other algorithms, it focuses specifically on presence-only data, which is typically the type of data available. Maxent is available, among others, as a stand-alone program [@phillipsMaxentSoftwareSpecies] and as a R package [@maxnetcit]. This tutorial focuses on the use of Maxent addons for [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/learn/overview/) @grassdevelopmentteam2024. As an example, we will use this to map the potential distribution of the Almond-eyed Ringlet (*Erebia alberganus*), a butterfly found in parts of Austria, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Serbia, and Switzerland [@vanswaay2010].

This tutorial was developed as part of a course on species distribution modeling (SDM) aimed at assessing the impacts of climate change on natural environments. It therefore assumes that users are familiar with the fundamentals of species distribution modeling (SDM) and the underlying biogeographical principles. If not, see [this free online course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8nSYhbf9nDSotrn-JSZiJki1sTnnw3yS) by BCCVL for a comprehensive introduction to the concepts and principles of SDM. For a more in-depth discussion, see the paper by Elith et al. [-@elith2009].

Users are also assumed to be familiar with GRASS. If not, see [Appendix A](A1_grassbasics.qmd) for a quick introduction, and check out the list of introductory and advanced [tutorials](https://grass.osgeo.org/learn/tutorials/) and courses. And if you have questions or got stuck, see if the [GRASS community](https://grass.osgeo.org/support/community/) can help you out.
