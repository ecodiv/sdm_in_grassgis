  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in ``established use.'' Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

  abstract = {1. Species are shifting their ranges at an unprecedented rate through human transportation and environmental change. Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models' assumptions that species are at equilibrium with the environments used to train (fit) the models, and that the training data are representative of conditions to which the models are predicted. Here we explore modelling approaches that aim to minimize extrapolation errors and assess predictions against prior biological knowledge. Our aim was to promote methods appropriate to range-shifting species.2. We use an invasive species, the cane toad in Australia, as an example, predicting potential distributions under both current and climate change scenarios. We use four SDM methods, and trial weighting schemes and choice of background samples appropriate for species in a state of spread. We also test two methods for including information from a mechanistic model. Throughout, we explore graphical techniques for understanding model behaviour and reliability, including the extent of extrapolation.3. Predictions varied with modelling method and data treatment, particularly with regard to the use and treatment of absence data. Models that performed similarly under current climatic conditions deviated widely when transferred to a novel climatic scenario.4. The results highlight problems with using SDMs for extrapolation, and demonstrate the need for methods and tools to understand models and predictions. We have made progress in this direction and have implemented exploratory techniques as new options in the free modelling software, MaxEnt. Our results also show that deliberately controlling the fit of models and integrating information from mechanistic models can enhance the reliability of correlative predictions of species in non-equilibrium and novel settings.5.Implications. The biodiversity of many regions in the world is experiencing novel threats created by species invasions and climate change. Predictions of future species distributions are required for management, but there are acknowledged problems with many current methods, and relatively few advances in techniques for understanding or overcoming these. The methods presented in this manuscript and made accessible in MaxEnt provide a forward step.},

  abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

The new release (ver. 3.4.0) will be hosted online by the American Museum of Natural History, along with future versions. It contains small functional changes, most notably use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) transform to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog transform derives from the recently-published interpretation of Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package, maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output) as as an estimate of relative abundance. With these two open-source developments, we invite others to freely use and contribute to the software.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modeling, in combination with databases of specimen distribution records, is advocated as a solution to the problem of distributional data limitation in biogeography and ecology. The global biodiversity information facility (GBIF), a portal that collates digitized collection and survey data, is the largest online provider of distribution records. However, all distributional databases are spatially biassed due to uneven effort of sampling, data storage and mobilization. Such bias is particularly pronounced in GBIF, where nation-wide differences in funding and data sharing lead to huge differences in contribution to GBIF. We use a common Eurasian butterfly (Aglais urticae) as an exemplar taxon to provide evidence that range model quality is decreasing due to the spatial clustering of distributional records in GBIF. Furthermore, we show that such loss of model quality would go unnoticed with standard methods of model quality evaluation. Using evaluations of model predictions of the Swiss distribution of the species, we compare distribution models of full data with data where a subsampling procedure removes spatial bias at the cost of record numbers, but not of spatial extent of records. We show that data with less spatial bias produce better predictive models even though they are based on less input data. Our subsampling routine may therefore be a suitable method to reduce the impact of spatial bias to species distribution models. Our results warn of automatized applications of species distribution models to distributional databases (as has been advocated and implemented), as internal model evaluation did not show the decline of model quality with increased spatial bias (but rather the opposite) while expert evaluation clearly did.},

  abstract = {Aim The extent of the study area (geographical background, GB) can strongly affect the results of species distribution models (SDMs), but as yet we lack objective and practicable criteria for delimiting the appropriate GB. We propose an approach to this problem using trend surface analysis (TSA) and provide an assessment of the effects of varying GB extent on the performance of SDMs for four species. Location Mainland Spain. Methods Using data for four well known wild ungulate species and different GBs delimited with a TSA, we assessed the effects of GB extent on the predictive performance of SDMs: specifically on model calibration (Miller's statistic) and discrimination (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic plot, AUC; sensitivity and specificity), and on the tendency of the models to predict environmental potential when they are projected beyond their training area. Results In the training area, discrimination significantly increased and calibration decreased as the GB was enlarged. In contrast, as GB was enlarged, both discriminatory power and calibration decreased when assessed in the core area of the species distributions. When models trained using small GBs were projected beyond their training area, they showed a tendency to predict higher environmental potential for the species than those models trained using large GBs. Main conclusions By restricting GB extent using a geographical criterion, model performance in the core area of the species distribution can be significantly improved. Large GBs make models demonstrate high discriminatory power but are barely informative. By delimiting GB using a geographical criterion, the effect of historical events on model parameterization may be reduced. Thus purely environmental models are obtained that, when projected onto a new scenario, depict the potential distribution of the species. We therefore recommend the use of TSA in geographically delimiting the GB for use in SDMs.},

Presence-only data consist of a sample of locations with observed presences and a separate group of locations sampled from the full landscape, with unknown presences. We propose an expectation--maximization algorithm to estimate the underlying presence--absence logistic model for presence-only data. This algorithm can be used with any off-the-shelf logistic model. For models with stepwise fitting procedures, such as boosted trees, the fitting process can be accelerated by interleaving expectation steps within the procedure. Preliminary analyses based on sampling from presence--absence records of fish in New Zealand rivers illustrate that this new procedure can reduce both deviance and the shrinkage of marginal effect estimates that occur in the naive model often used in practice. Finally, it is shown that the population prevalence of a species is only identifiable when there is some unrealistic constraint on the structure of the logistic model. In practice, it is strongly recommended that an estimate of population prevalence be provided.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs), which relate recorded observations (presences) and absences or background points to environmental characteristics, are powerful tools used to generate hypotheses about the biogeography, ecology, and conservation of species. Although many researchers have examined the effects of presence and background point distributions on model outputs, they have not systematically evaluated the effects of various methods of background point sampling on the performance of a single model algorithm across many species. Therefore, a consensus on the preferred methods of background point sampling is lacking. Here, we conducted presence-background SDMs for 20 vertebrate species in North America under a variety of background point conditions, varying the number of background points used, the size of the buffer used to constrain the background points around the occurrences, and the percentage of background points sampled within the buffer (``spatial weighting''). We evaluated the accuracy and transferability of the models using Boyce index, overlap with expert-generated range maps, and area overpredicted and underpredicted by the SDM (and AUC for comparability with other studies). SDM performance is highly dependent on the species modelled but is affected by the number and spread of background points. Models with little spatial weighting had high accuracy (overlap values), but extreme extrapolation errors and overprediction. In contrast, SDMs with high transferability (high Boyce index values and low overprediction) had moderate-to-high spatial weighting. These results emphasize the importance of both background points and evaluation metric selection in SDMs. For other, more successful metrics, using many background points with spatial weighting may be preferred for models with large extents. These results can assist researchers in selecting the background point parameters most relevant for their research question, allowing them to fine-tune their hypotheses on the distribution of species through space and time.},

  abstract = {The natural complexity of ecological communities regularly lures ecologists to collect elaborate data sets in which confounding factors are often present. Although multiple regression is commonly used in such cases to test the individual effects of many explanatory variables on a continuous response, the inherent collinearity (multicollinearity) of confounded explanatory variables encumbers analyses and threatens their statistical and inferential interpretation. Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r {$\geq$} 0.28 or r2 {$\geq$} 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multicollinearity.},

  abstract = {When creating designed experiments, it is not always possible to run the experiment at the exact settings required to maintain orthogonal effects. However, this is not measurement error when precise measurements of the settings can be made once the experiment begins. A comparison is made for a 15-run Box--Behnken design using both the intended design settings and the actual design settings. Variance inflation factors are used to measure the induced collinearity in the effects. Two cutoff values are suggested for use to determine when an effect's variance inflation factor is too large to keep that effect in the model.},

  abstract = {Spatial biases are a common feature of presenceâ€“absence data from citizen scientists. Spatial thinning can mitigate errors in species distribution models (SDMs) that use these data. When detections or non-detections are rare, however, SDMs may suffer from class imbalance or low sample size of the minority (i.e. rarer) class. Poor predictions can result, the severity of which may vary by modelling technique. To explore the consequences of spatial bias and class imbalance in presenceâ€“absence data, we used eBird citizen science data for 102 bird species from the northeastern USA to compare spatial thinning, class balancing and majority-only thinning (i.e. retaining all samples of the minority class). We created SDMs using two parametric or semi-parametric techniques (generalized linear models and generalized additive models) and two machine learning techniques (random forest and boosted regression trees). We tested the predictive abilities of these SDMs using an independent and systematically collected reference dataset with a combination of discrimination (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve; true skill statistic; area under the precision-recall curve) and calibration (Brier score; Cohen's kappa) metrics. We found large variation in SDM performance depending on thinning and balancing decisions. Across all species, there was no single best approach, with the optimal choice of thinning and/or balancing depending on modelling technique, performance metric and the baseline sample prevalence of species in the data. Spatially thinning all the data was often a poor approach, especially for species with baseline sample prevalence {$<$}0.1. For most of these rare species, balancing classes improved model discrimination between presence and absence classes using machine learning techniques, but typically hindered model calibration. Baseline sample prevalence, sample size, modelling approach and the intended application of SDM outputâ€”whether discrimination or calibrationâ€”should guide decisions about how to thin or balance data, given the considerable influence of these methodological choices on SDM performance. For prognostic applications requiring good model calibration (vis-Ã -vis discrimination), the match between sample prevalence and true species prevalence may be the overriding feature and warrants further investigation.},
